## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- Git CLI installed
- Python, pip and git are all available as command-line commands (add to the path if needed)

Virtual environment will be created in *PyfaEnv* folder. Project will be cloned and run from the *PyfaDEV* folder. Separate virtual environment will be created so required libraries won't clutter the main python installation.

> Commands and screens were created on Windows 10. Please, update all the paths according to your OS.

## Setting up the project manually

Clone the repository
```
git clone <repo> PyfaDEV
```

Create the virtual environment
```
python -m venv PyfaEnv
```

Activate the virtual environment

```
For cmd.exe: PyfaEnv\scripts\activate.bat
For bash: source <venv>/Scripts/activate
```
> For other OS check [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

Install requirements for the project from *requirements.txt*
```
pip install -r PyfaDEV\requirements.txt
```
> For some Linux distributions, you may need to install separate wxPython bindings, such as `python-matplotlib-wx`

Check that the libs from *requirements.txt* are installed
```
pip list
```

Build translations and database:
```
python scripts\compile_lang.py
python db_update.py
```

Test that the project is starting properly
```
python PyfaDEV\pyfa.py
```

## Running tests

Switch to the proper virtual environment
```
For cmd.exe: PyfaEnv\scripts\activate.bat
For bash: source <venv>/Scripts/activate
```

Install pytest 
```
pip install pytest  
```

Switch to pyfa directory.

Run tests (any will do)
```
python -m pytest
py.test
```
