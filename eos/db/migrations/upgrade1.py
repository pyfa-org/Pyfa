"""
Migration 1

- Alters fits table to introduce target resist attribute
- Converts modules based on Oceanus Module Tiericide
    Some modules have been deleted, which causes pyfa to crash when fits are
    loaded as they no longer exist in the database. We therefore replace these
    modules with their new replacements

    Based on https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/patch-notes-for-oceanus
    and output of itemDiff.py
